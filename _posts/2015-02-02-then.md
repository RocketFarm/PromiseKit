# `then`

Some asynchronous patterns in Objective-C can make holding on to relevant state dirty:

{% highlight objectivec %}

- (void)theCowJumpedOverTheMoon:(Moon *)moon {
    UIAlertView *alert = [UIAlertView …];
    alert.delegate = self;
    self.moonWeHoldForTheAlert = moon;
    [alert show];
}

- (void)alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView didDismissWithButton:(NSInteger)index {
    if (index != alertView.cancelButton) {
        [self.moonWeHoldForTheAlert continueJump];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

View controller properties are for view controller state, not for objects that exist during temporary state transitions. It’s gross to use properties like this. The `moon` should only be referenced inside `-theCowJumpedOverTheMoon`.

Calling this synchronously would solve that, we wouldn’t need to store the moon as property since we can still reference the `moon` parameter:

{% highlight objectivec %}

- (void)theCowJumpedOverTheMoon:(Moon *)moon {
    UIAlertView *alert = [UIAlertView …];
    NSInteger index = [alert showSynchronously];
    if (index != alert.cancelButton) {
        [moon continueJump];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

No transitory state held in properties *and* half the code!

Sadly, there is no `showSynchronously` method on `UIAlertView`, the closest we can get is using promises:

{% highlight objectivec %}

- (void)theCowJumpedOverTheMoon:(Moon *)moon {
    UIAlertView *alert = [UIAlertView …];
    [alert promise].then(^(NSNumber *dismissedButtonIndex){
        if (dismissedButtonIndex.integerValue != alert.cancelButton) {
            [moon continueJump];
        }
    });
}

{% endhighlight %}

Tapping the alert button ***then*** continues the jump.

{% include big.html param="We use <code><a href='http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/PromiseKit/1.4.2/Classes/PMKPromise.html#//api/name/then' class='external-link'><b>then</b></a></code> to access a promise’s value" %}

Promises have a `value`. When they are *pending* the value is `nil`. When they have *resolved* their value is **not** `nil`. Calling `then` on a promise feeds the value to the block you provide, if the promise is pending your block is called *later*, if the promise has been resolved your block is called (almost) immediately.

<aside>Technically we provide a <code>value</code> method on <code>PMKPromise</code>, but if the promise is pending it will return <code>nil</code>. Always using <code>then</code> abstracts away the asynchronicity, meaning you have one code path whether or not the promise has resolved.</aside>

PromiseKit comes with categories that make `UIAlertView`, `UIActionSheet`, `NSURLConnection`, `UIViewController`, `CLLocationManager`, etc. “thenable”. We even try to be super handy, eg. passing an `UIImagePickerController` (etc.) instance to PromiseKit’s `promiseViewController:animated:completion` method automagically handles the usual delegation behind the scenes giving you clean, easy, block-backed promises.

By itself these are great reasons to use PromiseKit. But promises are more powerful than just `then`.
